Hi Humans, 

User lklein8 here, making changes to this file and making history. I wonder if 2000 years from now, someone will find this file and load it up to their superroboarchaicdigitalreader machine they use to decode digital information from the past? This is the year 2016. 

This version modification should be on branch readme-edits2
